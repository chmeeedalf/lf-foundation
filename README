lf-foundation is a Legacy-free libFoundation.  Most of the deprecated methods
and classes from Cocoa are completely absent from this, and we make extensive
use of Objective-C++ and brand new (3.2+) features from clang.

It requires:
- a very recent clang (trunk)
- libdispatch
- a patched ICU (patch included)
- libexecinfo
- libxml2
- dbus
- libffi
- Alepha -- an external library currently only publicly available from the
  original source of this library, at svn.icculus.org/gold
